This repository contains projects that are related to ethical hacking

These projects should only be used for educational purposes. I'm not resposible for how the file is used by other individuals.

Two files are available:

Encrypt.py: This file is responsible for encrypting all the content under the file's directory. Once the program is ran, a new file thekey.key is created. This file contains the encryption key.

Decrypt.py: This file is responsible for decrypting all the content that was encrypted once the Encrypt.py file was executed.
